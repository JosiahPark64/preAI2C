### booleans
# determine if the following statement is true or false
# you can test these in the interpreter or using print statements
True and True
False and True
True or False
False and True or False
False and (True or False)

### converting data types
# what is the difference between implicit and explicit type conversion?
# determine if the following statements result in errors or not
5 + '5'
5 + int('5')
int(5.2) + int('5')
5.2 + float('5')
5 and '5' # bonus question, does this evaluate to true or false?
[1, 2] or [3, 4] # bonus question, does this evaluate true or false?
True + 5
False + 5

my_guess = input('Enter a guess')
print('10 times your guess is ' + 10 * my_guess)

# can you see how implicit conversions can get you in trouble...?

### binary and hexadecimal
# Convert 10 to binary
# Convert 255 to binary
# Convert 0b10101 to decimal
# Convert 0x10101 to decimal
# Perform a bitwise 'or' between 0b110101 and 0b101010, what is its decimal value
# Perform a bitwise 'or' between 53 and 42, what is its binary value
# Do the same with a bitwise 'and'

### string manipulation
# Convert 'hello' to bytes and then convert the bytes to an integer
# hint: use the encode method

# What's the difference between strip and replace?  When might you use both?

# Use index, len, slicing, and concatenation to 
# replace the word 'horrible' with 'beautiful'
# "It's a horrible day."
# "It's a beautiful day."

# scan through the 'is____' string methods in the documentation.
# how might you use those methods to clean a dataset?
